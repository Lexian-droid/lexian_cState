"lexian.stats" is a website dedicated to notifying our users about outages, issues, and updates. We will update this site whenever there is an issue on <b>our networks, infrastructure, etc.</b>

# How to stay informed?
As we work out our infrastructure, we want to allow our users to know exactly what is going on, which is why, we will be planning to integrate this site with a mailing list, so that you may subscribe to the mailing list and get updates via email.

In addition to that, we would like to integrate this website into the <b>Launcher</b> if that is possible. This way, we can directly inform you of potential outages.

# The Backend
### and what's powering it?
We are using a select couple services to host our backend, Such as the following:
- [ Netlify ]: For website hosting
- [ Netlify CSM ]: For content management
- [ cState ]: For the interface
- [ LetsEncrypt ]: For certificates
